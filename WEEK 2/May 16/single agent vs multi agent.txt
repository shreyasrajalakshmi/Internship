Single-Agent RAG
In a single-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, a single large language model (LLM) manages the entire pipeline—from understanding 
the query to retrieving relevant documents and generating the final response.

Key Characteristics:
A single model performs query analysis, retrieval guidance, and response generation.

Simple architecture with minimal components and integration points.

Direct flow: query → retrieval → response.

Advantages:
Lower computational and resource requirements.

Easier to deploy, monitor, and maintain.

Simplified debugging and performance tuning.

Faster response times due to reduced inter-process communication.

More straightforward prompt design and fine-tuning.

Limitations:
May experience cognitive bottlenecks with complex or multifaceted queries.

Lacks the modularity needed for specialized or domain-specific reasoning.

Limited in its ability to parallelize distinct tasks (e.g., retrieval vs synthesis).

Response quality may be constrained by a single model’s capabilities and perspective.




Multi-Agent RAG
Multi-agent RAG architectures distribute responsibilities among multiple specialized agents, each focusing on a specific part of the pipeline.

Key Characteristics:
Roles are divided among dedicated agents (e.g., Query Analyzer, Retriever, Synthesizer, Critic).

Agents interact via defined communication and coordination protocols.

Supports hierarchical or peer-to-peer agent structures.

Advantages:
Greater reasoning depth through specialization.

More effective at handling complex, multi-part or domain-specific queries.

Allows self-evaluation and refinement via critic or validator agents.

Improved adaptability to varied use cases and domains.

Enables parallel processing, improving scalability and responsiveness.

Limitations:
Increased architectural and operational complexity.

Greater demand on computational resources.

Requires robust coordination mechanisms between agents.

Debugging and performance tuning are more involved.

Higher latency possible due to multi-agent communication overhead.

Prompt design becomes more complex across interacting agents.
