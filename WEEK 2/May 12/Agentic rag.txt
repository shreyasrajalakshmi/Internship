Agentic RAG represents an advanced evolution of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation implementation, extending the capabilities of Large 
Language Models through specialized AI agents. While traditional RAG relies solely on LLMs with basic retrieval mechanisms, Agentic RAG transforms
these models into intelligent agents empowered to utilize tools, functions, and external knowledge sources for complex problem-solving. 

These systems can be designed with specialized agents focused on specific domains, such as taxation experts or language specialists.
The architecture of Agentic RAG consists of four principal components working as an integrated unit: user prompts that initiate queries, language
models responsible for response generation, specialized agents utilizing tools for information retrieval, and diverse knowledge bases containing 
unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data. This comprehensive framework addresses fundamental limitations of conventional RAG 
implementations by enabling access to multiple knowledge sources simultaneously.

Traditional RAG systems suffer from knowledge gaps due to their inability to access multiple knowledge bases concurrently. 
Agentic RAG overcomes this limitation by implementing agents that leverage external tools to address these gaps on demand. When user queries cannot
be answered from primary knowledge sources, external tools and databases can be immediately accessed to retrieve supplementary information, 
significantly enhancing response accuracy and completeness.


The multi-knowledge base and multi-agent approach of Agentic RAG substantially reduces hallucination risks while enabling more sophisticated 
information retrieval, comparison, and contrast capabilities. Context comprehension is enhanced through diverse knowledge base integration, 
allowing for more accurate responses to complex multi-part queries. Furthermore, the system's scalability makes it well-suited for AI applications
serving millions of users.


Key features distinguishing Agentic RAG include advanced planning and reasoning capabilities for multi-step tasks, sophisticated orchestration 
through coordinator agents that assign tasks to appropriate specialized agents, and the deployment of expert agents equipped with specific tools 
for particular domains. These systems can perform diverse functions including calculations, weather information retrieval, stock trend analysis, 
and data processing while supporting multiple knowledge bases from vector databases to traditional SQL implementations.

Common enterprise applications for Agentic RAG include automated FAQ generation from customer feedback, meeting summarization, comprehensive 
question-answering systems for internal company information, appointment scheduling platforms, enhanced AI chatbots, and customer support systems.
These implementations excel at retrieving information from heterogeneous enterprise data while enabling intelligent agent collaboration for 
problem-solving. When empowered with memory, reasoning, and planning capabilities, these systems can provide 24/7 enterprise question-answering 
services and analyze complex unstructured data across various formats.

Compared to traditional implementations, Agentic RAG delivers superior performance through connections with multiple databases, external tools, 
and functions. While classic RAG systems can retrieve and compare information within single documents, they are limited to single retrieval steps 
and lack information validation capabilities, making them vulnerable to errors and hallucinations. Additionally, traditional systems depend heavily
on well-crafted user prompts. In contrast, Agentic RAG systems can retrieve and synthesize information from multiple sources, support iterative 
retrieval processes, validate content accuracy, and function effectively with less precise prompts by drawing relevant information from broader 
knowledge sources independently.
